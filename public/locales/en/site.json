        "description": "I'll always be thankful to Spotify, for changing the music industry and allow us to play our favorite tracks, albums and playlists anywhere. For the past few years, even though with good intentions to provide more features for their users, in my opinion the app became bloated.\n\nMost of the time, either while working or gaming, I only want to play some saved album or playlist, I don't need to explore, discover or see more information about the track/artist.\n\nI'm relatively \"organized\", so I have a large set of playlists that match my mood and what I want to listen at the time. If you're like me, then FeatherPlay is made for you.\n\n",
